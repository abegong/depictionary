Depictionary
============

Depictionary is an amped-up version of pictionary where you can draw, act, or make sound effects to help people guess words. The only things not allowed are words and letters.  The game is paced fast---you score points for depicting and guessing clues, and everyone is always playing.

Project is a fun an excuse to learn a little bit about mobile development.  I work on it during Sunday afternoon naps---the only time in the week when my wife and kids are all asleep and I am not.
